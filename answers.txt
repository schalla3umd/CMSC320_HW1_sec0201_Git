Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

It allows us to track code changes we make, with the ability to restore older versions if need be.
Multiple people can contribute to the same project easily using Git and its features.
Through branching, developers can test out new code without having it affect the main codebase.


Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science can be used in the finance sector to detect fraud. Models are trained on past data to identify fraudulent transactions,
which are used to help protect users in real-world scenarios. Data that is used can include transaction amount, location, frequency, etc.
